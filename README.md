The app's design is responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes. This is achieved using CSS media queries. You can view the app on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops without any issues.

### Future Improvements

We have plans for future enhancements, including:

- Adding a 7-day weather forecast.
- Implementing user location detection.
- Improving the UI with more animations and styles.
